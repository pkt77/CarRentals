# Car Rentals

A Car Rental service for Revature

## Application Overview

---

Car Rentals start by creating an account with your personal information including your license. Your profile is then forwarded to an employee for review. Once your profile is approved, you receive a confirmation email and will now be able to reserve a vehicle to be rented. Vehicle rentals include selecting the type, whether or not you'd like GPS, the amount of car seats, and using Google Maps to select the location you want to pickup your vehicle. Once reserved, you will recieve an email detailing your reservation and your profile information.
